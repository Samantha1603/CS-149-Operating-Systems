We begin with defining the 75 students and enrolment duration of 120 quanta. Then we created strut for students that holds data such student ID, priority ID, class ID, arrival time, etc. Each student has its own unique ID. The main function initialize the mutex for 3 different class sections and 3 different priority levels of students with GS, RS and EE. After that the main function starts separate thread for 3 different class sections, a program thread and students thread.
